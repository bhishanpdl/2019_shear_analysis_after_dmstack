Notebook: flux_median_low_high_shear_comparison.ipynb
purpose: compare shear below and above the median of flux (i.e. two flux bins)
result: gm_low/gm_high = 1.22 and for gc_low/gc_high = 1.21
further work: the ratio is high, create more bins of flux and find mean shears in those bins.

Notebook: compare_shears_for_different_flux_bins.ipynb
purpose: compare shears in multiple bins of flux
result: 
fitted the parameters for flux vs gm and flux vs gc.
