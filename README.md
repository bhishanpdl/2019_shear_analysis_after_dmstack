# Using binder
- Go to binder org: https://mybinder.org/
- Paste main repo url: https://github.com/bpRsh/2019_shear_analysis_after_dmstack
- Wait few minutes.
- We will get the link: https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/bprsh-2019_shea-s_after_dmstack-4nnqv4n2/tree
- Note: it is always better to use requirements.txt and runtime.txt (python==3.6) files in each repo.
